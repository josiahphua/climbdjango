<h4>Introduction to the App</h4>
<p>
I am a climber, which is a more prestigious way of calling a hobo.
</p>
<p>
The app idea came about when my friends and I decided to have a small competition between ourselves
in climbing the most difficult routes on the wall with the least amount of tries(in the context of climbing, attempts).
<br/>
We would also have to book our timeslots and coordinate with one another on who is booking for whom.
And as our chat will always be filled with a lot of other nonsensical talks, a platform which allows users to coordinate with their followers and following came to my mind. 
<br/>
Though for now, the function is not yet up.

<h4>Language used</h4>
<li>
Python with Django Framework: Is nice like that. Or cool like that.
</li>
<li>
JavaScript with React: Redux is a pain to setup, but an elixir after setup.
</li>
<p>
I used django djoser for authentication and react redux for the frontend of it.
<br/>
Djoser helps set up the backend required for authentication to work. I will just have to follow a strict way of saving data and the access points for which to grab data.
React redux was not easy to setup as there are many possible scenarios, thanks to djoser. But it was pretty straightforward with the help of the documentation.

<h4>Showcasing the App</h4>
<p>
As of now, the app is still a work in progress and I can get the user to submit their routes and attempts through a form into the database. I can then populate the data in a form of a table.
